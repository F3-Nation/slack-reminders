# slack-reminders
Scripts used to remind Slack users of their commitments.

## Prerequisites
You must already have PAXminer, Weaslebot, and QSignups installed for this to work.

## Process
The app will take a list of Slack Workspaces and iterate through them. It will query PAXminer and QSignups during a specified time period and check to see if any backblasts are missing. The app will group by Q (if available from QSignups) and send a message detailing which backblasts are missing in a direct message. Then it will check the day of the week. If the current day of the week is the one configured for that workspace, it will group missing backblasts by SiteQ if available from the PAXminer `aos` table and send an alert detailing the missing backblasts to the Site Q in a direct message. It will then group missing backblasts by AO and message the AO channel detailing which ones are missing.

## Inputs
Parameters for each Slack Workspace are stored in the F3 Data Model (https://f3-nation.github.io/F3-Data-Models/). Specifically, the `slack_spaces` table. Each entry requires the following fields to be filled in `team_id`, `bot_token`, `settings`. `settings` is a JSON field. It can have properties in it associated with other apps, but it needs at least the following properties to be considered by this app.

```
{
  "log_channel_id": "C082N3FS123",
  "paxminer_database_name": "f3kcwestside",
  "reminder_backblast_grace_period_days": 1,
  "reminder_backblast_max_notification_days": 75,
  "reminder_backblast_notification_day_of_week": 1
}
```
Definitions for each field are indicated below.

### Input Definitions

1. paxminer_database_name
    - The name of the workspace's PAXminer database (e.g. f3denver, f3alliance)
    - This is also used to designate operations in the logs
1. team_id
    - The Slack-defined ID for your workspace (see https://docs.louply.io/how-tos/how_to_get_slack_workspace_id/ for instructions on finding it.)
1. log_channel_id
    - The Slack-defined ID of a channel you want this app to write logs to. This is useful for troubleshooting. It will write 1 message to this channel every time it runs and will indicate how many missing backblasts it found.
    - You can use the #paxminer_logs channel or another channel. Generally, it should be a channel not commonly used by users. You will most likely end up muting this channel.
    - See https://help.socialintents.com/article/148-how-to-find-your-slack-team-id-and-slack-channel-id for instructions on finding a Channel ID
    - If this is set left empty (e.g. ",,") then no logs will be written
1. reminder_backblast_grace_period_days
    - How many days do you want to give a Q to post before messaging them?
    - Example: If this is set to 0, they will be notified right away. For example, if they Q at 5:30 AM and they do not post the backblast by the time the app runs at 9 AM, then they will be notified.
    - Example: If this is set to 1, they have 1 day to post their backblast. If they Q at 5:30 AM on Monday and they haven't posted their backblast by the time the app runs at 9 AM, they won't be notified. But if they still haven't posted by the time the app runs at 9 AM on Tuesday, they will be notified.
    - This can be any positive integer.
1. reminder_backblast_max_notification_days
    - How long should a Q be notified before giving up?
    - Example: If this is set to 75, the app will notify the Q of a missing backblast every time the app runs until more than 75 days have passed since the Q.
    - This can be any positive integer.
1. reminder_backblast_notification_day_of_week
    - A Q will be notified every time the app runs if they don't post. To prevent alarm fatigue on the Site Q and AO, they will only be notified one day a week.
    - The number for the variable represents the day of the week Site Q and AO should be notified. 0 is Monday and 6 is Sunday.
1. bot_token
    - For this app to post messages to Q's, Site Q's, and AOs, it will need certain permissions. You will have to have a custom app installed in your workspace and grant that app the required permissions. You can use an existing app (like PAXminer), or create a new one. https://medium.com/applied-data-science/how-to-build-you-own-slack-bot-714283fd16e5 has a basic run-through of creating an app. When you get to the part about assigning bot token scopes, select "chat:write" and "chat:write.public". You can get the Bot User OAuth Token from the top of the page where you assign scopes.

## Logging
Basic logs are written to the backend system using Python's Print() command. If a channel ID is specified in the common inputs, a message will also be posted there for each run.
